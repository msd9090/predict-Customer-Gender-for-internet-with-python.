# 📊 Telco Analytics: Customer Behavior & Churn Prediction
This repository explores the behavioral patterns of telecommunications customers, specifically looking at how demographics like gender and internet service types influence customer loyalty and churn rates.

# 🧐 Scientific Data Overview: Internet Usage & Demographics
In this analysis, we dive deep into the relationship between a customer's profile and their service preferences. One of the primary focuses is understanding the distribution of Internet Users by Gender and how this affects the business's bottom line.

# 1. Gender Distribution & Digital Adoption
We analyze whether there is a significant difference between Male and Female users in terms of their internet service choices.

Fiber Optic vs. DSL: Data shows how different genders lean towards specific technologies.

Usage Patterns: Understanding if one gender group is more likely to subscribe to additional services like Streaming TV or Online Security.

# 2. The Churn Phenomenon (The Science of Retention)
"Churn" is the scientific term for when a customer stops using a service. By analyzing the intersection of Gender, Tenure, and Internet Service, we can identify high-risk segments. For instance:

Do female users on Fiber Optic contracts have a higher retention rate?

How does the absence of internet service affect the churn probability across genders?

This model uses these variables to predict the likelihood of a user leaving, allowing for proactive retention strategies.
